      <h3>The Effects of Natural and Clean Food .</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Carbohydrate foods are known as soothing and calming. In people who
          consume carbohydrate nutrients such as pasta, bread, biscuits, the
          body gets a general peace and calm for the increase of “serotonin”
          substance with the effect of chemical transmitters called “tryptophan”
          on the brain. The brain needs activity glucose. The lettuce you choose
          is a natural tranquilizer, it is good for insomnia. These fibrous
          foods with low blood sugar index, like energy use in the body, also
          prevent possible fat formation. Magnesium-containing nuts and
          potassium-containing bananas are also nutrients that are effective in
          protecting against depression by balancing body values.

          Products such as fish containing omega-3 fatty acids also resist
          depression. Rich foods such as walnuts, peanuts, milk, yoghurt, dark
          green leafy vegetables, carrots, almonds are also a source of
          happiness, says experts. For sudden sadness, you can ease your sadness
          by eating strawberries, grapes, oranges, apples. Especially orange
          juice will revitalize you and add dimension to your need energy during
          the day. Foods containing animal protein, "phenyl alanine" containing
          yen passes into the brain and turn into "what adrenaline" and
          adrenaline. Those who eat these meat and meat products are more active
          and active. These are just a few. For more food and nutrients, we can
          strengthen our physical and mental health. A study in American prisons
          shows that when prisoners eat more salads, less fast food, the
          in-prison crime rates drop greatly. There are also some of the food's
          souls. It is directly proportional to the eating and drinking habits.
          But in general, high-calorie and weight-loss foods are also the foods
          that make us most happy. Isn't that the main reason you attacked
          chocolate or dessert in some periods? It is impossible to think that
          what we eat has an effect on the formation of morality and character
          in human beings. After all, what we eat does not only feed our bodies.
          It also has an impact on our soul and character.
