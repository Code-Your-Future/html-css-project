                Claim <span class="color">Asylum</span> in the<br />United Kingdom
            </h2>
            <p>You must apply for asylum if you want to stay in the UK as a refugee.
<br /><br />
To be eligible you must have left your country and be unable to go back because you fear persecution.
              <br /><br />
              Apply for a visa if you want to come to the UK for another reason (for example to work, study or remain with family). If you’re already in the UK and want to remain with family living here, apply for a family of a settled person visa.
              <br /><br />
              You should apply when you arrive in the UK or as soon as you think it would be unsafe for you to return to your own country. Your application is more likely to be denied if you wait.
<br /><br />
After you apply you’ll have a meeting with an immigration officer (known as a ‘screening’) and then an asylum interview with a caseworker.
<br /><br />
You’ll usually get a decision on your application within 6 months.
              <br /><br />
              <b>You can get up to 2 years in prison or have to leave the UK if you give false information on your application.</b>
              <br /><br />
              <b>Waiting for your decision</b>
              <br /><br />
You’ll be told after your screening what you must do while you’re waiting for your asylum decision, for example report to a caseworker regularly (known as ‘reporting meetings’).
<br /><br />
You must tell the authorities if your situation changes.
<br /><br />
You won’t usually be allowed to work while your asylum claim is being considered.
              <br /><br />
              <b>Help you can get</b>
              <br /><br />
- You can get help with:
getting legal representation for your asylum claim<br />
- Living in the UK while you wait for your decision
              <br /><br />
              Children applying on their own
You can apply as a child on your own if you don’t have an adult relative who is also claiming asylum.<br /><br />

            <p class="left">
              You may be able to get housing and money to support you and your family while you’re waiting to find out if you’ll be given asylum.
<br /><br />
This also means your children will go to a free state school and you may get free healthcare from the National Health Service (NHS).
<br /><br />
You can still apply for short-term support if you’ve been refused asylum and are preparing to leave the UK.
<br /><br />
Call an asylum helpline for free help with asylum support or short-term support.

                Further<br>support <sapn class="color">for Refugee</sapn> from Migrant help!
            </h2>
            <p>
                We are a leading national charity offering support, guidance and accommodation to vulnerable migrants across the UK. Whether someone has fled persecution, escaped from slavery or found themselves in a situation that they do not understand, Migrant Help offers advice, support and a place of safety. Read more about who we are, what we believe and what we do.
             <br /><br />
              <b>What we do</b>
              <br /><br />
              <b>Advice and guidance to asylum seekers</b><br /><br />
We have been helping people who are fleeing from persecution, war and torture for over 50 years. Today, we are the leading UK organisation providing asylum advice and guidance services in the UK. Find out more about Asylum Help.
              <br /><br />
              <b>Specialist support for Victims of Trafficking</b><br /><br />
Slavery still exists in the UK today. We provide victims of human trafficking with the practical and emotional support they need to rebuild their lives.
              <br /><br />
              <b>Foreign National Detainee Services</b><br /><br />
People in immigration detention centres often have very limited understanding of the UK legal system, their rights or the English language. They may be asylum seekers whose claims are being processed or have been refused or individuals who have overstayed their visa. Our Foreign National Detainee Services provide the vital support and advice they need to understand the system and their situation.
              <br /><br />
              <b>Information and advice to Foreign National Prisoners</b><br /><br />
We work to ensure that foreign national prisoners fully understand their situation and can make informed choices so that they can move on positively with their lives. We provide appropriate advice and information during and at the end of their sentences.
