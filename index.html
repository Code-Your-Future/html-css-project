             <p class="poem">
                 I am the first Earth Mother of all fertility<br>
                 I am the Source I am the Nile I am the African I am the beginning<br>
                 O Arabia, how could you so conveniently have forgotten<br>
                 While your breath still hangs upon the threads of my springs<br>
                 O Egypt, you prodigal daughter born from my first love<br>
                 I am your Queen of the endless fresh waters<br>
                 Who rested my head upon the arms of Narmer Ka Menes<br>
                 When we joined in one our Upper and Lower Lands to create you<br>
                 bosom of my being<br>
                 How could you so conveniently count down<br>
                 In miserable billions of petty cubic yards<br>
                 The eternal drops of my life giving Nile to you<br>
                 Beginning long before the earth fell from the eye ball of heaven,<br>
                 O Nile, that gush out from my breath of life<br>
                 Upon the throats of the billions of the Earth's thirsty multitudes,<br>
                 O World, how could you so conveniently have forgotten<br>
                 That I, your first fountain, I your ever Ethiopia<br>
                 I your first life still survive for you?<br>
                 I rise like the sun from the deepest core of the globe<br>
                 I am the conqueror of scorching pestilences<br>
                 I am the Ethiopia that "stretch her hands in supplication to God"<br>
                 I am the mother of the tallest traveler on the longest journey on Earth<br>
