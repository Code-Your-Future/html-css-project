             <p class="summary">
                 Tsegaye grew to become one of his country's most prominent literary figures and an international voice for African culture and peace. A prolific writer, he created more than 30 plays and numerous poems. Many in Ethiopia have claimed him to be that nation's "Shakespeare". For Tsegaye, poetry and theater were paths to inspiring hearts and condemning violence.

             <p>
                 Tsegaye revolutionized theatre with his portrayals of the poor and the forgotten, war, imperialism, human failings, and courage.

                 While his work delighted the public, 18 of his 33 plays were banned by one government or another. He put into words what many could not say. Tsegaye's poem, "The Day's Hunger Consumed," voiced an Ethiopian public's outrage at the news of famine raging in the north

             <p>
                 Besides compositions of his own Tsegaye translated Shakespeare (Hamlet and Othello being the most popular of these works), as well as Moliere's Tartouffe and Doctor Despite Himself, and Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage

                  "I crave for knowledge. I envy tolerant, peaceful folks. I am frightened by ignorance. I loathe violence."

               While Tsegaye received many honors, one of his most prized was when the African Union selected one of his poems for its anthem. In the poem, Tsegaye wrote, "Let us make Africa the tree of life."
             </p>
             <p>
                 Despite his health problems Tsegaye was active – and creative – to the last. Ever true to his African aspirations in 2002 he composed a poem on the continent's cultural heritage, which the newly-established African Union adopted as its anthem; it read:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
                 <p>
                   "All sons and daughters of Africa, flesh of the son and flesh of he sky, Let us make Africa the tree of life."

                 <p>
                   Through his literature, Tsegaye's pride in Ethiopia and love for Africa will live with us forever.

                 I am the first Earth Mother of all fertility<br>
                 I am the Source I am the Nile I am the African I am the beginning<br>
                 O Arabia, how could you so conveniently have forgotten<br>
                 While your breath still hangs upon the threads of my springs<br>
                 O Egypt, you prodigal daughter born from my first love<br>
                 I am your Queen of the endless fresh waters<br>
                 Who rested my head upon the arms of Narmer Ka Menes<br>
                 When we joined in one our Upper and Lower Lands to create you<br>
                 bosom of my being<br>
                 How could you so conveniently count down<br>
                 In miserable billions of petty cubic yards<br>
                 The eternal drops of my life giving Nile to you<br>
                 Beginning long before the earth fell from the eye ball of heaven,<br>
                 O Nile, that gush out from my breath of life<br>
                 Upon the throats of the billions of the Earth's thirsty multitudes,<br>
                 O World, how could you so conveniently have forgotten<br>
                 That I, your first fountain, I your ever Ethiopia<br>
                 I your first life still survive for you?<br>
                 I rise like the sun from the deepest core of the globe<br>
                 I am the conqueror of scorching pestilences<br>
                 I am the Ethiopia that "stretch her hands in supplication to God"<br>
                 I am the mother of the tallest traveler on the longest journey on Earth<br>
