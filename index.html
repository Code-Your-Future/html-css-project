            <h1>Types of Roses</h1>
            <p>A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus 
                Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. 
                There are over three hundred species and thousands of 
                cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect 
                shrubs, climbing or trailing with stems that are often 
                armed with sharp prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape 
                and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from 
                white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to 
                Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, 
                and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are 
                all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. 
                Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. 
                Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to 
                climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different 
                species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the 
                development of the wide range of garden roses.</p>

            <h2>Iceberg</h2>

            <p>Iceberg is a modern cluster-flowered floribunda rose cultivar.
                It is commercially available in two main forms: a bush and a 
                standard, both produced by a form of grafting known as budding. 
                The size and shape of bush forms depend on growing conditions 
                and pruning regime: it is usually about 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) high
                 and 1 metre (3.3 ft) wide, though in hot climates it can reach 
                 2 metres (6.6 ft) high and if lightly pruned can become a 
                 graceful shrub. Leaves are small, light green and glossy. 
                 Blooms are about 5 cm in diameter and have 25 to 35 petals. 
                 They grow in clusters on long stems. Buds are long and pointed.
                  The fragrant flowers usually appear abundantly throughout the 
                  year.</p>

             alt="Mollineux" style="height:100px;">
            <p>Shrub roses include a wide variety of roses that do not fit into 
                any other category. Many are a cross between Old Garden Roses and 
                Modern Roses, and combine traits from each. Generally, they are hardy,
                easy-care plants. Bloom style may be single, cabbage-like or anything
                 in between, and fragrance level varies. Most shrub roses are repeat 
                 bloomers, and their growth is generally graceful and spreads easily.</p>
