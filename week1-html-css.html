                        The <strong>avocado</strong> health craze on social media is
                        clearly there for a reason! Avocado is a fruit containing many
                        enzymes, primarily lipase which is commonly in charge of digesting
                        fats and getting rid of fat molecules in the bloodstream.
                        Additionally, the enzymes in avocado can help one avoid
                        indigestion. Avocados can be enjoyed in many forms: as salads,
                        guacamole, or by themselves. Whichever way you choose, you will
                        not regret eating it.

                        Our brains produce serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps calm and soothe us, giving us a more relaxed, cheerful mood. We recommend not only adding the best foods for good moods to your diet, but also incorporating natural supplements like BrainMD’s Serotonin Mood Support. These natural supplements can help ease anxiety, maintain a healthy mood and self-confidence, and can even help sustain deep sleep, a healthy appetite, and social engagement.
                        7 Foods to Eat for a Brighter Mood
                        Here are seven mood-boosting foods that you should add to your next grocery list:
                        1 . Berries
                        Blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries are all high in vitamin C, which helps cope with cortisol, a hormone that is released during times of stress.
