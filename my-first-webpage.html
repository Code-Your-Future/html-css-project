                  The <strong>avocado</strong> health craze on social media is
                  clearly there for a reason! Avocado is a fruit containing many
                  enzymes, primarily lipase which is commonly in charge of digesting
                  fats and getting rid of fat molecules in the bloodstream.
                  Additionally, the enzymes in avocado can help one avoid
                  indigestion. Avocados can be enjoyed in many forms: as salads,
                  guacamole, or by themselves.

                  Our brains produce serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps calm and soothe us, giving us a more relaxed, cheerful mood. We recommend not only adding the best foods for good moods to your diet, but also incorporating natural supplements like BrainMD’s Serotonin Mood Support. These natural supplements can help ease anxiety, maintain a healthy mood and self-confidence, and can even help sustain deep sleep, a healthy appetite, and social engagement.

                      If you sometimes indulge in sweets when stressed or upset, you know how immediately satisfying they can be.

                      Curiously, eating more fruits and vegetables is linked to lower rates of depression .

             <p>How can food affect mood?
             <br><br>
             Knowing what foods we should and shouldn’t be eating can be really confusing, especially when it feels like the advice changes regularly. However, evidence suggests that as well as affecting our physical health, what we eat may also affect the way we feel.
             Improving your diet may help to:
             improve your mood
             give you more energy
             help you think more clearly.</p>
